description: In this article, the author explores the reason why ethical issues arise from information technology and major ethical theories that we apply in order to get closer to our ethical ideals. Ethical issue is said to arise when one party that tries to achieve their goal negatively affect another party to achieve their goal. With Australian Computer Society’s code of ethics, we guide ourselves to make more ethical world of information technology.</br>These code of ethics are applied by trying to please countless ethical theories. Since it is almost impossible to please all the theories, four major theories are often applied in information technology.</br>The first theory emphasises an agent’s duty. Meaning it relies on people to do the right thing to make good society.</br>The second theory is the pursuit of happiness. Which requires that us to assess the loss and benefit that inflicts on the stakeholders.</br>The third theory is the pursuit of virtue. Theory which focuses on improving character or ability of the agent.</br>The fourth theory is the pursuit of justice. Which seeks all stakeholders to have equal opportunity to reach their potentialities.</br>The article further explores about the future of ethics in information technology.</br>This article should be read because it gives you multiple examples of ethical theories for you to apply when it is needed.
