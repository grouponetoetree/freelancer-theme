description: Security in computing, fourth edition, covers a variety of topics surrounding security in the field of information technology. These range from databases to operating systems to legal and ethical issues. The later of which will be the focus of this summary.</br>The eleventh chapter, Legal and Ethical Issues in Computer Security, breaks down the information in a clear and concise manner for readers to understand. This is done by introducing a segment with a detailed explanation, followed by paragraphs holding examples, case studies and diagrams. This effectively makes the chapter extremely useful for readers who are both new to the topics or simply need to revise them.</br>The book becomes of further use to readers as it provides a clear table of contents that includes subchapters so that readers can easily jump to the section they wish to read. This is further assisted by the index which provides readers with another method of finding information alongside the table of contents. The bibliography also allows for readers to find more sources if they wish to further expand their knowledge on the topics explored.
