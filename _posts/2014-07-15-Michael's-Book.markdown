description: The book “Social, Ethical and Policy Implications of Information Technology” written by Brennan is a document that explores the social, ethical and policy implications derived from a series of information and communication technologies as the basis of the discussion. One such technology, most commonly referred to as the internet as mentioned in the book leads to a potential issue known as the “Digital Divide”. Below outlines a brief summary of the contents within the chapter.</br>Digital divide is the idea that members within a particular country or community are denied of the opportunity to gain access to information and communication technologies. However, it has been recently redefined as a term to describe a society where a particular section of the population has the ability to utilise internet-related technologies and the remaining portion does not. Additionally, the author mentions that there is a need to clarify the term access in the context of digital divide therefore, access to an ICT consists of the “regular and reliable physical access to the ICT (whether through personal ownership or through shared or public resources), regular access to any assistive devices necessary for a person to make use of the ICT and sufficient knowledge, training and confidence to make use of the ICT” (Brennan, 2004). There has been an ongoing debate as to whether this digital divide is of moral significance.</br>With that being said, Brennan argues that there are four primary aspects in which a digital divide may have morally significant social impacts on the ICT deprived society.</br>These are -</br>Nonpositional benefits of access - Inequalities in access to an ICT may give those with access a benefit that does not make those without access any worse off than they would have been if nobody had access.</br>Positional benefits of access - Inequalities in access to an ICT (within a given community) may give rise to inequitable distribution of benefits (or opportunities for benefits) the equitable distribution of which is morally desirable.</br>Availability of alternative means - Whenever and wherever access is the only means to access services and gain benefits, then that proportion of the population lacking access will be disadvantaged relative to those benefits. The moral importance of access to the benefits determines the moral significance to be attributed to lack of access to the ICT that is a means to the benefits.</br>Disbenefits of access - Those who lack the access to ICT may be in a position where they do not perceive themselves as disadvantaged, thereby raises a question of whether or not those individuals refrain from utilising ICT out of choice or out of necessity.
