description: The article focuses on developments in the use of IT (e.g. self-service technologies, Big Data, the Internet of Things) as a basis for assessing their implications for public sector values and ethics. Kernaghan argues that “the subject areas of values and ethics and of information technology have received substantial, but largely separate, attention” (Kernaghan, 2014). He claims that there is an increase in volume of literature that solely examines the effects of IT advances on a particular value (an example would be privacy) and there is a limited amount of resources that specifically focuses on the extensive implications of these advances for the values and ethics of public sectors in general.</br>In the 1990s, scholars such as Professor Norbert Weiner of MIT and many others developed a “human-values approach” to computer ethics that raises the importance and consideration for protecting core human values such as life, health, security and happiness. Soon after, in the late 1990s, a new approach to computer ethics was encouraged called the “value-sensitive computer design”. The idea is that to prevent computer-ethics related issues, when a new technology is being developed, early on into the development stage will primarily shift attention towards avoiding harm to human values.</br>As businesses expand their client communications through social media, there have been numerous accounts where “public servants” make a public comment in the form of criticism of government policies and programs. The question lies whether there should be a boundary in which public servants “should be permitted to exercise democratic right of freedom of expression in the information age” (Kernaghan, 2014).</br>The idea of openness and transparency of information being so readily accessible by the public. However useful, Open Data and Big Data possess large management issues. As Open Data has provided full access to government information which can be perceived as excessive and unreasonable amounts of data, Kernaghan argues that there needs to be a method that can determine how much information should be released and in what form. Furthermore, with the ever increasing Big Data available, there will be a need for a substantial number of skilled analysts that are able to extract meaningful information from raw data. Therefore, a compromise between the demand for openness and the demand for privacy must be established within the public sector management of IT.</br>With the use of wireless networks provided by organisations to public servants, employees have the added responsibility to maintain honesty and integrity when accessing the organisation’s wireless network. The company also has the obligation to provide a solution to these ethical concerns as employees may access their network for purposes such as social networking, accessing pornographic and other questionable materials or deliberately or unintentionally releasing confidential information.
