description: This article focus on the relation between information ethics (IE) and business ethics (BE) under the impact of information and communication technologies(ICTs). The goal of this article is to articulate and defend an informational approach to the conceptual foundation of business ethics by using ideas and methods developed in information ethics.</br>Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have profoundly changed many aspects of life, including the nature of the entertainment, education, healthcare, industrial production, business, social relations and conflicts. Therefore, they have had, and continue to have, a deep, widespread and increasing influence on our moral lives and on contemporary ethical debates.</br>Luciano structured the article to 5 parts except the introduction and conclusion. In the first part, Luciano talked about after the informationalization of our environment, how the IE impacted on the BE, what is the methodological contribution based on it and also the nature of the moral relations and interactions between IE and BE. In the second part, Luciano created some mathematical models to show the relations in BE. After this, he combined the model he built in part 2 to support his arguments about the relations in BE under ICTs in the third part. Moreover, in the fourth part, he argued about the normative pressure points at great length. In the last part, he summarized a little bit of the contents before and then how the IE and BE reacted, how they influenced each other.</br>This article provides a good understanding of ethics in business and networking. With the models that Luciano created, the relationship between IE and BE could help readers to have a better understanding about the networking ethics.
