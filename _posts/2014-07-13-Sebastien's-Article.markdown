description: This peer-reviewed article discusses the lack of ethics which are found in the Information Technology industry. IT professionals often have guidelines to follow, but are not legally binded to these guidelines; meaning there a few consequences for breaking these ethical codes (dependant on the position). With IT professionals having access to fragile/sensitive data it is important that these professionals abide by these guidelines.</br>The article also discusses how other industries, such as medicine or law, must follow their guidelines or face persecution in court. It is apparent that the writer believes that a similar persecution should occur to IT professionals.</br>This article provides an understanding of ethics in IT and its lack of power/control. As well as providing an overview of the different types of ethics set out by other industries or companies.
