description: The peer reviewed article “Privacy and Ethical Concerns in Internet Security” written by Rebecca and James Rutherfoord discusses the issues surrounding privacy in computer ethics, both the legal and ethical aspects of it. The authors went into great depth discussing what privacy is, covering several different viewpoints such as how it is perceived by the public, its relation to the information age, accuracy and accessibility issues as well as detailing any other definitions of privacy aside from the main definition referenced within the article. The article continues by discussing how privacy is affected by the laws of Australia, listing up to 25 Australian laws that relate to privacy before discussing the effect they have on workers in Australia.</br>Rutherfoord R. and Rutherfoord J. discuss how ethics partake in privacy, noting that it is a “much more nebulous area for the internet to deal with” as “many [businesses] fail to recognize we have entered the information age or appreciate its importance.” The discussion on ethics is brief, however it provides a broad introduction for readers to understand the ethical aspects of privacy without any prior knowledge of the topic.</br>On the whole, “Privacy and Ethical Concerns in Internet Security” provides a broad introduction to legal and ethical issues in privacy, clearly aimed at readers who wish to gain a rough understanding of the topic without going into too much depth.
