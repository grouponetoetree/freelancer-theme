                    <p>Ethics in general is a broad topic, which can be narrowed down into what is more commonly known as information ethics.
                     Information ethics surrounds the concepts of information use, moral codes and ethical standards within the Information Technology industry.
                     These guidelines are necessary for IT professionals as they provide a moral framework should an individual encounter an ethical dilemma.
                     Ethical guidelines are commonly followed by IT professionals in order to cover grey legal areas, ensuring that the professionals are thinking selflessly to increase the quality of the final product.
                     There isn’t one set of guidelines followed by IT professionals, however there are many overlapping features between guidelines, mostly focusing on public interest and honesty in one’s work.
                     While these ethics are common practice in industry, IT professionals are not required by law to follow these guidelines, however breach of said guidelines may result in workplace counselling.
