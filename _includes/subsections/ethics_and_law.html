  <h1>Ethics and Law</h1>
  <p>As the field of information technology is constantly expanding, a large majority of IT professionals follow an ethical guidelines code of conduct either being self-imposed or a company/industry based ethical guidelines. While said guidelines are expected to be followed at all times, there are situations where it becomes questionable to follow them, usually when there is conflict with Australian Law.</p>
  </br>
  <p>There are some key differences between laws and ethics that distinguishes themselves from each other, the major difference being the severity of punishment. Breaking a law may result in prison sentences, large fines, community service, etc. while a breach of ethics may only result in workplace consultation, time off work, and in worst case, unemployment; overall less serious punishments. This difference plays a large role in scenarios where ethics and law conflict with one another, often with individuals weighing up risk versus reward.</p>   
  </br>
  <p>A common case of a crossover between ethics and law is with online piracy. In this scenario, there is a large video game company who sells over 8 million copies of their game for the first 12 months. Would it be ethical for a person who could not afford to purchase the game to illegally download a copy, despite the law clearly saying otherwise? Some may argue that it would be ethical as the individual would not be harming the company on a grand scale as one sale in comparison to 8 million is insignificant, despite the legal repercussion if the individual were to be caught. If the situation were slightly different however, would it alter how the individual should act? If the company was smaller and did not sell as well, only selling approximately 60,000 copies of the game would it still be ethical for the individual to illegally acquire the game, as a company of this size will be directly affected every sale made? Some would argue not. By downloading the game in this way it stops the possibility of ever making a sale with the consumer at a later date, as the individual may change their mind should the price go down or they gather more disposable income.</p>
  </br>
  <p>There are many other scenarios between ethics and law that have fluctuating responses depending on how many people are affected, how serious the outcome would be for party involved and the future repercussions of each choice.</p>
